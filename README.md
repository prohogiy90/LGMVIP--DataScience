# LGMVIP--DataScience
This repository contains my solutions to tasks from one month "Let's grow more"  Data Science internship.

Task 1

Iris Flowers Classification ML Project :
This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

Task 2

Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

Task 3

Music Recommendation:

Music recommender systems can suggest songs to users based on their listening patterns.
Datasetlinks: https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-music-recommendation-challenge/data

Task 4:

Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

Task 5:

Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism 

As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.
You can choose any of the tool of your choice  
Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

Task 6:

Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm. Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 

Task 7:

Develop A Neural Network That Can Read Handwriting:

Begin your neural network machine learning project with the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge and using Tensorflow and CNN. It has a very user-friendly interface that’s ideal for beginners. Dataset: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database 

Task 8:
